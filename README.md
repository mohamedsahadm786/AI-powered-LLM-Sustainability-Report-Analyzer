#  **AI-Powered ESG Sustainability Report Analyzer**

An **LLM-based NLP tool** designed to analyze **multilingual corporate sustainability reports**, identify **digitalization needs**, and map them to **ERGOSIGN service offerings** — supporting data-driven B2B outreach and regulatory readiness under CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive).

---

##  **Project Overview**

This project builds an **end-to-end AI pipeline** using **GPT-4o-mini** to extract, analyze, and summarize key insights from **300+ page sustainability reports**. It supports **multilingual input**, automates **text extraction**, identifies **manual or inefficient ESG-related processes**, and outputs structured recommendations for **digital transformation**.

The system is integrated with a **Streamlit UI**, allows **batch processing**, and includes a **GPT cost tracker** for efficient resource usage.

---

##  **Key Features**

- ✅ **LLM-Powered NLP Pipeline**  
  Uses **GPT-4o-mini** to detect digitalization opportunities from unstructured ESG report content.

- 🌍 **Multilingual Support**  
  Detects and translates non-English content (supports **10+ languages**), enabling global report coverage.

- 🧾 **Scanned & Native PDF Handling**  
  Utilizes **PyMuPDF** and **Tesseract OCR** to parse both native and scanned PDF formats.

- 📊 **Structured Insight Extraction**  
  Generates a 6-column table: `Page Number`, `Evidence`, `Area`, `Suggested Digitalization`, `Reason`, `Confidence Score`.

- 🔄 **Dynamic Web Scraping for Service Mapping**  
  Automatically matches identified needs to **20+ ERGOSIGN services** using **BeautifulSoup** + **Requests**.

- 📤 **Multi-Format Output**  
  Exports final reports as both **Excel** and **PDF** files for internal stakeholders and sales teams.

- 🌐 **Interactive Web Interface**  
  Built with **Streamlit**, allowing users to upload reports, trigger the pipeline, and view/download results.

- 💰 **API Cost Tracking**  
  Tracks GPT API usage in real time to manage and optimize cost per report.
